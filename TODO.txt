Ship:
	-hull
	-max shield -- osztódik 6 felé?
	-inertia dampeners -- max speed
	-thrust -- accelaration / turn -- turnspeed probably should be seperate stat
	-weapon mounts

main_controller:
	-optimization - store ship positions in a dictionry (or something like it), so that i dont have to get
	the scene tree every left click. would need to update it after every move. idk if its worth it
